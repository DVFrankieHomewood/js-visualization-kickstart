## Javascript Visualization Skeleton
Just a quick bare bones set up to get over the blank page effect when looking at an empty js project.

### *Execute*
You can look at the results of your script by opening the `index.html` file in the browser of your choice. In this repo expect it to be a spinning red square until you make your required changes.

### *Debug*
You can debug your code in the inspector window of the browser (in most places this is CTRL-SHIFT-I) here there is a handy dandy debug window where you can run js real time or just poke around.
